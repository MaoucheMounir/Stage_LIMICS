ADDENDUM:

RADIOLOGIC STUDIES:  Radiologic studies also included a chest
CT, which confirmed cavitary lesions in the left lung apex
consistent with infectious process/tuberculosis.  This also
moderate-sized left pleural effusion.

HEAD CT:  Head CT showed no intracranial hemorrhage or mass
effect, but old infarction consistent with past medical
history.

ABDOMINAL CT:  Abdominal CT showed lesions of
T10 and sacrum most likely secondary to osteoporosis. These can
be followed by repeat imaging as an outpatient.
