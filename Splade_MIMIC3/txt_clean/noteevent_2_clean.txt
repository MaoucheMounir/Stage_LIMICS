Chief Complaint:
81 yo F smoker w/ COPD, severe TBM, s/p tracheobronchoplasty 
s/p perc trach 

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronchoscopy 3/31,4/2,3,, , 
s/p trachealplasty 
percutaneous tracheostomy  after failed extubation
down size trach on  to size 6 cuffless


History of Present Illness:
This 81 year old woman has a history of COPD. Over the past five

years she has had progressive difficulties with her breathing.
In
 she was admitted to  for respiratory failure
due
to a COPD exacerbation. Due to persistent hypoxemia, she
required
intubation and a eventual bronchoscopy on  revealed marked

narrowing of the airways on expiration consistent with
tracheomalacia.
She subsequently underwent placement of two
silicone stents, one in the left main stem and one in the
trachea. During the admission the patient had complaints of
chest
pain and ruled out for an MI. She was subsequently discharged to

 for physical and pulmonary rehab. Repeat bronchoscopy
on
 revealed granulation tissue at the distal right lateral
wall of the tracheal stent. There was significant malacia of the

peripheral and central airways with complete collapse of the
airways on coughing and forced expiration. Small nodules were
also noted on the vocal cords. She has noticed improvement in
her
respiratory status, but most recently has been in discussion
with Dr.   regarding possible tracheobronchial plasty

with mesh. Tracheal stents d/c  in anticipation of
surgery.
In terms of symptoms, she describes many years of intermittent
chest pain that she describes as left sided and occurring at any

time. Currently, she notices it about three times a week, and
states that it seems to resolve after three nitroglycerin.
She currently is dependent on oxygen and wears 1.5-2 liters
around the clock. She has frequent coughing and brings up "dark
sputum".

Brief Hospital Course:
82 y/o female admitted  for consideration of
tracheoplasty.
Bronchoscopy done  confirming severe TBM. Underwent
tracheoplasty , complicated by resp failure d/t mucous
plugging, hypoxia requiring re-intubation resulting in prolonged
ICU and hospital course. Also developed right upper extrem DVT
from mid line.

Pain- Epidural accidently d/c'd POD#1, pt briefly used dilaudid
PCA intermittently w/ fair pain control. Pt required
re-intubation for resp failure d/t secretions and PCA d/c at
that time. Propofol for sedation while intubated. Sedation d/c'd
 for weaning trial w/ ETT- failed trial. Trach -weaning
efforts as below. Minimal c/o pain since . Presently pain
free.

Neuro- Initially intact- post op aggitation, inhibiting weaning
efforts . Psych eval -Started on zyprexa and ativan w/
improvement in anxiety. Presently A+Ox3- cooperative and lovely.

Resp- Extubated POD#2 then required re-intub   for hypoxia
d/t poor cough and mucous plugging. SIMV/PS alt w/CMV at night
x4-5d, with CPAP attempts during day.
Bronchoscopy qd  for secretion management. Bronch 
revealed swollen epiglottis, bronch  - good leak w/ ETT cuff
deflated. Bronch  for eval/trach placement. Last bronch 
w/ min secretions present, sputum sent.
 perc trach done(#8 Portex- cuffed low pressure maintained to
preserve tracheoplasty site).  CPAP15/peep5 initiated post
trach placement. Weaning ongoing.  - Aggressive weaning
w/ increasing episodes of CPAP, progressing to Trach Mask.
-Trach mask overnight w/ no episodes of SOB, or
hemodynamic instability. Trach changed to #6 portex- capped and
 well x48hrs on 2LNP. productive cough. Aggressive PT as
well w/ OOB > chair -tid to total 4-6hr qd. Ambulation
~100-120 ft  w/ PT assist.

ID- Vancomycin started post-op for graft prophylaxis. Fever
spike  w/ BAl & sputum sent> + MRSA. Vanco cont to 
weeks post trachealplasty. Fever low grade , > cultured-
no new results. - WBC 20.8 .

Cardiac-Hypertension controlled w/ hydralazine IV, then d/c and
cont controlled. HR 65-75 NSR. Avoiding B Blockers. Lasix 20mg
IV qd.
- RUE redness and swelling at site of midline, RUE DVT by
ultrasound, midline d/c; heparin gtt started and therapeutic
range monitored.   changed to Lovenox sq . Coags in good
control  (48.2/13.8/1.2)
Access- R midline placed  for access- clotted  and
d/c'd.  RUE redness and swelling and DVT via ultrasound. - L
brachial PICC line placed- TPN resumed.

GI-Large hiatal hernia- unable to place enteral feeding tube at
bedside or underfluoro. Re-attempt  by EGD doboff tube
placed distal esophagus, dislodged in 12hours and removed.

Nutrition- PPN/TPN initiated - . PICC placed
. Speech and Swallow eval - rec change trach form #8
to #6 Portex to allow improved epiglotis and oropharyngeal
movement to assist w/ swallowing. Then re-eval.  Trach changed
 to #6 cuffless portex trach. Passed repeat swallow eval and
 diet of regular solids w/ thin liquids- CHIN TUCK to
swallow thin liquids. Give meds whole w/ apple sauce. WOULD
RECOMMEND repeat video swallow eval in  days to possibly
