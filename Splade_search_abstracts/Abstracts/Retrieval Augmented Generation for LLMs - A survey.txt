Large Language Models (LLMs) showcase impressive capabilities but encounter challenges like hallucination,
outdated knowledge, and non-transparent, untraceable reasoning
processes. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged
as a promising solution by incorporating knowledge from external
databases. This enhances the accuracy and credibility of the
generation, particularly for knowledge-intensive tasks, and allows
for continuous knowledge updates and integration of domainspecific information. RAG synergistically merges LLMsâ€™ intrinsic knowledge with the vast, dynamic repositories of external
databases. This comprehensive review paper offers a detailed
examination of the progression of RAG paradigms, encompassing
the Naive RAG, the Advanced RAG, and the Modular RAG.
It meticulously scrutinizes the tripartite foundation of RAG
frameworks, which includes the retrieval, the generation and the
augmentation techniques. The paper highlights the state-of-theart technologies embedded in each of these critical components,
providing a profound understanding of the advancements in RAG
systems. Furthermore, this paper introduces up-to-date evaluation framework and benchmark. At the end, this article delineates
the challenges currently faced and points out prospective avenues
for research and development.
