We propose a new method for vectorizing a document using the relational characteristics of
the words in the document. For the relational characteristics, we use two types of relational
information of a word: 1) the centrality measures of the word and 2) the number of times that
the word is used with other words in the document. We propose these methods mainly
because information regarding the relations of a word to other words in the document are
likely to better represent the unique characteristics of the document than the frequencybased methods (e.g., term frequency and term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency). In
experiments using a corpus consisting of 14 documents pertaining to four different topics,
the results of clustering analysis using cosine similarities between vectors of relational information for words were comparable to (and more accurate than in some cases) those
obtained using vectors of frequency-based methods. The clustering analysis using vectors
of tie weights between words yielded the most accurate result. Although the results obtained
for the small dataset used in this study can hardly be generalized, they suggest that at least
in some cases, vectorization of a document using the relational characteristics of the words
can provide more accurate results than the frequency-based vectors.
