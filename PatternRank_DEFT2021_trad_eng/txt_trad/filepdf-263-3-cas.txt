 Mr. G... 70 years of age, with a history of smoking and exposure to asbestos, was hospitalized for macroscopic haematuria. Cystoscopy found intravesical polypoids lesions of the retrotrigonal right side and dome. The extension balance objectivated small adenopathy along the cave vein in front of the right renal pedicle as well as an engaining of the right ureter responsible for an important uretero-hydronephrosis. Urinary cytologies were positive in favour of low-grade urothelial tumour injury. Histological examination of the bladder transurethral resection material identified a well differentiated urothelial tumour with a surface papillary component and musculoskeletal infiltration, with tumour proliferation moving into "nid-like" tumour Ã¯lots. The treatment consisted of systemic remedial chemotherapy due to the inextractability of the lesion and peritoneal carcinosis associated with laparotomy. The patient's death occurred nine months later.
