 Mr. E., 70 years old, had been followed for five years for myeloma, rheumatoid arthritis, and rectal and renal amylosis. While he did not have old urination problems, he had an episode of acute retention of urine. At the rectal touch, the prostate was flexible and homogeneous, estimated at 40 grams. An ultrasound confirmed the existence of a prostatic hypertrophy of 45 grams, of homogeneous appearance, and revealed multiple polypod endovesical lesions. An endoscopic resection of the prostate and all vesical lesions was performed. Macroscopically, the prostatic tissue was identical in appearance to adenomyomatous tissue; the vesical lesions were diffused throughout the vesical wall, red, and had the form of boules. Anatomopathological examination concluded with prostatic and vesical amylosis on the presence of perivascular and interstitial amyloid deposits. Immunohistochemistry showed that it was an AL-type amylosis with no anti-AA antibody marking. The immediate follow-up was simple, but the patient died 4 months later of the complications of his myeloma.
