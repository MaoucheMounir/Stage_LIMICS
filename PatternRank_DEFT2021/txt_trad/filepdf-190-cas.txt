 A 58-year-old woman was admitted for abdominal pain in the right flank with nausea and vomiting. The blood pressure on her admission was 100/60 mmHg. On physical examination, a sensitivity of the abdomen to palpation at the upper right level was noted. Abnormal biological results were as follows: leukocytes 12600/mm3, hemoglobin 8.1 g/dl, haematocrit 25%. Urine analysis revealed microscopic haematuria. A CT scan of the abdomen showed a right kidney mass of 15 cm in diameter and a retroperitoneal hematoma (Figure 1). The ultrasound found the same elements. The patient was monitored. The hematocrite increased from 29 to 20% in four hours. As a result of life-threatening bleeding, the patient was transferred to the operating room. During surgical exploration, a mass of 15x15x20 cm, encapsulated with dark grey and yellowish-white colouring was found. The mass was developed from the right renal hile. There was intra-tumor haemorrhage and a rupture of the mass was noted. The bleeding was caused by the rupture of veins just around the right kidney hile. A straight nephrectomy and mass removal were performed. No post-operative complication was reported. Anatomopathological mass analysis showed a renal angiomyolipoma (Figure 2).
