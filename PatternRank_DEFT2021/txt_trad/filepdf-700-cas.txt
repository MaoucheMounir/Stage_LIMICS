 It was a 50-year-old man who was in consultation for a first access to palpitations that had evolved over the past 2 days, occurring at rest and persistent for a few minutes. There was no chest pain, dyspnoea, syncope or lipothymia. No cardiovascular history was detected; there was no evidence of a male-type risk factor. There was no high blood pressure or diabetes or ethylotabagic intoxication. Clinical examination was normal hemodynamic state was stable and no evidence of heart failure was shown. Biology showed no elevation of myocardial necrosis markers nor admission nor distance including ultrasensitive troponins I. Intake electrocardiogram revealed a broad tachycardia beating at 150 per minute (fig. 1). A few moments later, after having received a charge dose of 1200 mg of amiodarone the electrocardiographic plot had shown a sinus rhythm with the presence of a delta wave and negative waves in antero-septo-apical (fig. 2). Thus we did not resort to an electric defibrillation before the well tolerated and rapidly resolutive character of the arrhythmia. The absence of clinical ultrasound arguments in favour of ischemic heart disease and especially the rhythmic context of antidromic tachycardia in Wolff Parkinson White's syndrome field allowed us to account for a Chatterjee effect of the repolarization anomalies presented by the patient, even though his anomalies were persistent.
