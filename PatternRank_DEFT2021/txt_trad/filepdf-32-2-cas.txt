 Ms. L. K 50 years of age, diabetic, is admitted to the department of urology, for intermittent urethrrhragia with vulvar pain and dyspareunia associated with chronic retention of urine. The vaginal touch finds a urethro-vulvary tumor of the anterior wall of the vagina, hard, mobile with a urethro-vaginal fistula. Urethrocystoscopy finds a budding tumor, ulcerated, bleeding from contact arriving to the vesical cervix. The biopsy with histological study confirms the diagnosis of primitive carcinoma of the adenocarcinoma type of urethra. The abdomino-pelvian scanner shows the extension of the tumor to the vesical base with suspicion of pelvic lymphonal metastasis. The patient underwent an anterior pelvectomy with uretero -sigmoidodistomy type Coffey and bilateral lymphonodal ilio-obturator curage (refused by the patient of the external derivation). No adjuvant treatment has been initiated and clinical and radiological control after a 4 year decline is normal, the patient nevertheless made an episode of acute pyelonephritis treated medically. She is regularly followed in consultation. The numbers of urea and creatinine are normal.
